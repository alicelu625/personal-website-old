## Alice's Personal Website (React)

This web application was built for the purpose of showcasing my web development skills as well as my projects and experiences, which gets regularly updated. For mobile/tablet support, a toggle side navigation was implemented in place of a top navigation. As I learn more about web development, I will also implement new features and designs to improve the user interface and user experience.
