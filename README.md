## Alice's Personal Website (React)

This web application was built for the purpose of showcasing my web development skills as well as my projects and experiences, which gets regularly updated. As I learn more about web development, I will also implement new features and designs to improve the user interface and user experience.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:
##### `npm install`

then

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
